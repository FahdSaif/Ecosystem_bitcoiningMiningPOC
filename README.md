# Bitcoin Mining POC

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Proof of Concept (POC) for Bitcoin mining. It is designed to simulate mining operations using Python and Docker.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Docker (for containerization)
- Internet connection for mining operations (simulated)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FahdSaif/bitcoiningMiningPOC.git


Navigate to the project directory:
cd bitcoiningMiningPOC


Code Explanation
Dockerfile
The Dockerfile sets up a container environment with the required dependencies. It pulls a base Python image and installs any necessary libraries to run the mining simulation.

mine.py
This Python script simulates the mining process. It includes functions to simulate finding a valid block and checking conditions for mining:

mine_block function: Simulates mining by generating random numbers (nonces) and checking if the block condition is met (here it's a simple modulus check).
time.sleep(1): Simulates the time delay typically experienced during mining.
Usage
To run the mining simulation, use Docker or run the Python script directly if you prefer:

python mine.py
